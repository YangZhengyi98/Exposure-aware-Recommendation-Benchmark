## Introduction

Recommendation is an important task that helps us identify useful information everyday, thus making it a thriving research topic in both academia and industry. However, there exists several issues among recent studies. Different researchers usually use different datasets and perform different experiment settings, which may be not representative so that others are likely to get different results on other datasets or settings. Besides, different evaluation protocols are utilized in different works, and some seems to be rational but no one can guarantee the fairness. All above leads to the difficulty for others to reproduce their studies or even get totally different results. Therefore, a fair comparision platform among different recommendation models is a necessity in the long run. So we have done extensive experiments in a well-known recommendation library: [NeuRec](https://github.com/wubinzzu/NeuRec) on two exposure-aware datasets with the most representative traditional and modern recommendation models. Same experimantal settings and evalution matrics are maintained across different models to make the comparision among them as fair as possible.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/YangZhengyi98/Exposure-aware-Recommendation-Benchmark/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/YangZhengyi98/Exposure-aware-Recommendation-Benchmark/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
